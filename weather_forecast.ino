Certainly! Here's a simple code example using Arduino to fetch weather data from an API and display it on an LCD screen. Please note that you will need to connect an Arduino board and an LCD display for this code to work.

```cpp
#include <Wire.h>                  // Include the Wire library for I2C communication
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>     // Include the LiquidCrystal_I2C library for LCD

LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27, 16, 2); // Set the LCD address to 0x27 for a 16x2 display

void setup() {
  lcd.begin(16, 2);                 // Initialize the LCD display
  lcd.print("Weather Forecast");    // Display initial message
  delay(2000);
  lcd.clear();                      // Clear the display
}

void loop() {
  // Fetch weather data from API (replace API_KEY and CITY_ID with your own values)
  String url = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?id=CITY_ID&appid=API_KEY";
  String weatherData = getWeatherData(url);

  // Extract relevant information from weather data (modify as per the API response structure)
  String temperature = extractTemperature(weatherData);
  String humidity = extractHumidity(weatherData);
  String description = extractDescription(weatherData);

  // Display weather information on the LCD
  lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
  lcd.print("Temp: " + temperature + "C");
  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
  lcd.print("Humidity: " + humidity + "%");

  delay(60000); // Delay for 1 minute before updating the weather information
}

// Function to fetch weather data from the API
String getWeatherData(String url) {
  // Use appropriate library (e.g., Ethernet, WiFi) to make an HTTP GET request to the API
  // and retrieve the weather data. Return the response as a String.
}

// Function to extract temperature from weather data
String extractTemperature(String weatherData) {
  // Extract the temperature value from the weather data and return it as a String.
}

// Function to extract humidity from weather data
String extractHumidity(String weatherData) {
  // Extract the humidity value from the weather data and return it as a String.
}

// Function to extract weather description from weather data
String extractDescription(String weatherData) {
  // Extract the weather description from the weather data and return it as a String.
}
```

In this code, you will need to replace `API_KEY` with your own API key from OpenWeatherMap and `CITY_ID` with the ID of the city for which you want to fetch weather data. Additionally, you will need to implement the functions `getWeatherData`, `extractTemperature`, `extractHumidity`, and `extractDescription` to handle making the API request, parsing the response, and extracting the relevant weather information.

Please note that this is a basic example, and you may need to modify it according to the specific API you are using and the structure of the weather data it provides. Also, remember to include the necessary libraries and set up the hardware connections properly.
